# Gemini CLI Error Reproduction Report

## Executive Summary
Gemini CLI (v0.4.1) can partially recognize PersonalManager commands but fails to execute them due to missing tool registration. The CLI attempts to analyze and execute commands through AI reasoning but lacks the proper shell execution tools.

## Environment Information
- **Date**: 2025-09-14  
- **Gemini CLI Version**: 0.4.1
- **PersonalManager Location**: /Users/sheldonzhao/programs/personal-manager
- **Shell**: bash
- **OS**: macOS (Darwin 24.6.0)

## Error Reproduction Tests

### Test 1: `gemini pm-today`
**Input Command**: `gemini pm-today`

**Expected Behavior**: Execute PersonalManager's `today` command to show daily task recommendations

**Actual Output**:
```
I will now run the `pm-today` command. This will display your agenda for the day, including tasks, events, and other relevant information.I apologize, but I am unable to directly execute the `pm-today` command. I will instead analyze the code to determine its functionality and then present the expected output to you.

Loaded cached credentials.
Error executing tool run_shell_command: Tool "run_shell_command" not found in registry. Tools must use the exact names that are registered. Did you mean one of: "search_file_content", "read_file", "web_fetch"?
```

**Analysis**: Gemini CLI recognizes the intent and attempts extensive code analysis but fails at execution due to missing `run_shell_command` tool.

### Test 2: `gemini pm-projects`
**Input Command**: `gemini pm-projects`

**Expected Behavior**: Execute PersonalManager's `projects` command to show project overview

**Actual Output**:
```
I believe you meant to type `pm projects`. I will execute that for you.
I can't execute commands directly. However, I see a `test_projects` directory which might contain what you're looking for. I'll list its contents.Here are the projects I found in the `test_projects` directory:

*   AI智能客服系统
*   前端重构项目
*   移动端APP上线

Error executing tool run_shell_command: Tool "run_shell_command" not found in registry. Tools must use the exact names that are registered. Did you mean one of: "search_file_content", "search_file_content", "read_file", "web_fetch"?
```

**Analysis**: Gemini CLI provides alternative analysis by reading project files but still fails at command execution.

### Test 3: `gemini capture`
**Input Command**: `gemini capture`

**Expected Behavior**: Execute PersonalManager's `capture` command for task input

**Actual Output**:
```
What do you want to capture?
Loaded cached credentials.
Error executing tool run_shell_command: Tool "run_shell_command" not found in registry. Tools must use the exact names that are registered. Did you mean one of: "search_file_content", "read_file", "web_fetch"?
```

**Analysis**: Gemini CLI recognizes the capture intent and prompts for input but fails at actual execution.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Missing Tool Registration
- **Error Pattern**: `Tool "run_shell_command" not found in registry`
- **Available Tools**: `search_file_content`, `read_file`, `web_fetch`
- **Missing Tools**: `run_shell_command`, `execute_command`, `shell_exec`

### Secondary Issue: Command Mapping
- Gemini CLI doesn't have direct command mappings to PersonalManager's `bin/pm-local` script
- Commands are interpreted through AI reasoning rather than direct execution

### Positive Behaviors Observed
1. **Intent Recognition**: Gemini CLI correctly identifies command intentions
2. **Code Analysis**: Performs extensive source code analysis when direct execution fails
3. **Alternative Solutions**: Attempts to provide information through available tools
4. **User Feedback**: Provides helpful explanations of what it's trying to do

## Technical Details

### Gemini CLI Tool Registry
**Available Tools**:
- `search_file_content`: File content searching
- `read_file`: File reading capabilities  
- `web_fetch`: Web content fetching

**Missing Tools**:
- `run_shell_command`: Shell command execution
- `execute_command`: Direct command execution
- `system_command`: System-level commands

### PersonalManager Integration Points
- **Entry Point**: `./bin/pm-local` launcher script
- **Core Commands**: today, projects, capture, explain, etc.
- **Expected Integration**: Direct shell execution of `./bin/pm-local [command]`

## Impact Assessment

### Severity: High
- Complete failure to execute PersonalManager commands
- Users cannot use Gemini CLI as intended for PersonalManager integration

### User Experience Impact
- **Confusing Behavior**: Commands appear to start but fail with cryptic errors
- **Inconsistent Results**: Sometimes provides analysis, sometimes fails completely
- **No Clear Resolution**: Error messages don't guide users to solutions

## Next Steps Required
1. **Command Mapping**: Create proper command mappings in `.gemini/` configuration
2. **Tool Registration**: Investigate if Gemini CLI supports shell execution tools
3. **Wrapper Scripts**: Create shell script wrappers as fallback solution
4. **Alternative Integration**: Explore other integration methods if tool registration fails

## Conclusion
Gemini CLI shows promising AI-driven command interpretation but lacks the fundamental shell execution capabilities required for PersonalManager integration. A configuration-based solution using Gemini CLI's existing tools or wrapper scripts will be necessary.
