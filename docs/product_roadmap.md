## 1. Vision

To create a world-class, AI-powered personal management system that helps users achieve their goals, manage their time effectively, and live a more organized and productive life. `PersonalManager` will be an intelligent and proactive assistant that understands the user's needs and adapts to their workflow.

## 2. Guiding Principles

*   **AI-Native First:** The primary interface will always be conversational AI. The user experience should be as natural and intuitive as talking to a human assistant.
*   **Privacy and Security by Design:** User data is sacred. All data will be stored locally by default, and all cloud-based features will be opt-in.
*   **Extensible and Customizable:** The system will be designed to be extensible, allowing users to add new tools, integrations, and workflows.
*   **Focus on Action, Not Just Information:** The system should not just provide information, but should help the user take action and make progress on their goals.
*   **Continuous Learning and Improvement:** The system will learn from the user's behavior and feedback to become more intelligent and personalized over time.

## 3. Themes and Epics

### Theme 1: Foundation and Stability

*   **Epic 1.1: AI Tool Integration:** Make the entire `PersonalManager` toolset available to the AI agent.
*   **Epic 1.2: System Initialization and Configuration:** Create a seamless and intuitive setup process.
*   **Epic 1.3: Comprehensive Testing and Quality Assurance:** Ensure the system is robust, reliable, and bug-free.

### Theme 2: User Experience and Onboarding

*   **Epic 2.1: Interactive Onboarding:** Create a guided, interactive onboarding experience for new users.
*   **Epic 2.2: Natural Language Understanding and Flexibility:** Improve the AI's ability to understand complex and ambiguous commands.
*   **Epic 2.3: Context-Aware Assistance:** Enable the AI to understand the user's current context and provide more relevant assistance.

### Theme 3: Intelligence and Proactivity

*   **Epic 3.1: Proactive Task and Goal Management:** Enable the AI to proactively suggest tasks, goals, and projects.
*   **Epic 3.2: Deeper Integration with External Services:** Create deeper and more intelligent integrations with services like Google Calendar, Gmail, and others.
